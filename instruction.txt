the header should contain
"Logo"  "Catch Line/ Hook" "Contact Info"

Directly below it we would have a search bar for searching through our existing Recipe API

Below that we would have a "Featured Recipe" section that would be a random recipe from our API 
if no inputed ingredients

Then an ingredients div which would have search ingredients at the top
and then followed by a horizontal swipe to the right to select what type of ingredients are found
after selecting each ingredients the Featured recipe would be loaded into the recipes that include
the ingredients chosen
